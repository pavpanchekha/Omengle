Omengle --- Omegle for the polyglot-challenged
==============================================

Omegle is a site that randomly pairs strangers and invites them to talk
to one another.  It's great, except that you might be paired with
someone who doesn't speek your language.  Omengle rectifies that by
placing Google Translate between you and your partner.

The code is currently very clean and very featureless.
